- 👋 Hi, I’m @hpark215
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that has to do with tecnology — front end, back end, machine learning, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python in school. But for fun I am into html, css, and javascript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally any project in which I can provide anything and at the same time learn as much as possible.
